I am data scientist specializing in healthcare applications, my expertise lies in leveraging deep learning techniques to analyze complex medical data. With a background in electronics and communication engineering, I bring a unique perspective to data science. My significant contribution includes developing data analysis methodologies for detecting medical conditions, notably in glaucomatous visual field loss and prenatal healthcare.

In my current role, I apply deep learning to fetal heart rate analysis, focusing on cardiotocography (CTG) to improve early detection of risks in prenatal health.
